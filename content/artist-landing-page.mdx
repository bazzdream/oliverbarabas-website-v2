**Hello, i am german music producer Oliver Barabas!**

Since late 1999 i'm producing all kinds of EDM ranging from Trance to House to Pop music (old projects “DJ X-Dream”, “bazzdream”).

After a long break i started my comeback under my real name by participating in a remix contest for Gareth Emery's "Save Me" in August 2016. Since then i got some national and international radio airplays, Beatport Top 20 release chart positions and placements on music compilations like [Future Trance 80, Technobase.FM 16, Technobase.FM 17, Technobase.FM 18, Bounce Monsters Vol.1](#releases) and many more...

Enjoy listening to some of my [releases](#releases) and feel free to [contact](#contact) me!
