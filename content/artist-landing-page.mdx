Hi, i'm german music producer Oliver Barabas! 👋

Since late 1999 i've been producing all kinds of EDM ranging from Trance to House to Pop music (old projects “DJ X-Dream”, “bazzdream”).

After a long break I started my comeback under my real name by participating in a remix competition for Gareth Emery's "Save Me" in August 2016. Since then I've had several national and international radio airplays, Beatport top 20 chart placements and publications on music compilations like <AnchorLink href="#releases" style="color:inherit">Future Trance 80, Technobase.FM 16, Technobase.FM 17, Technobase.FM 18, Bounce Monsters Vol.1</AnchorLink> and many more...

Enjoy listening to some of my <AnchorLink href="#releases" style="color:inherit">releases</AnchorLink> and feel free to <AnchorLink href="#contact" style="color:inherit">contact</AnchorLink> me!
