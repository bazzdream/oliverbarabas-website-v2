**Hi, i'm german producer Oliver Barabas! 👋**

Since late 1999 i produced all sorts of EDM ranging from Trance to House to Pop music (old projects “DJ X-Dream”, “bazzdream”).

After a long break i started my comeback under my real name by participating in a remix contest for Gareth Emery's "Save Me" in August 2016. Since then i got some national and international radio airplays, Beatport Top 20 release chart positions and placements on music compilations like <AnchorLink href="#releases" style="color:inherit">Future Trance 80, Technobase.FM 16, Technobase.FM 17, Technobase.FM 18, Bounce Monsters Vol.1</AnchorLink> and many more...

Enjoy listening to some of my <AnchorLink href="#releases" style="color:inherit">releases</AnchorLink> and feel free to <AnchorLink href="#contact" style="color:inherit">contact</AnchorLink> me!
